# ALU-Networks-Summative-Project-2022-2023

## Overview
This repository showcases our group project for the Networks course during the 2022/2023 Academic Year (Term 1, Year 3) at African Leadership University (ALU) Rwanda. The project involves creating network solutions for different scenarios within the ALU Rwanda campus.

## Project Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Campus Network Design
- **Objective**: Develop a network scheme for ALU Rwanda to connect students, staff, guests, and administrators.
- **Tasks**:
  - Subnet the 172.16.0.0/16 network to create required network groups.
  - Configure VLANs and test their functionality.

### Scenario 2: Server Configuration and Testing
- **Objective**: Set up and test a web server, DHCP server, and DNS server in ALU's server room.
- **Tasks**:
  - Assign static IP addresses to servers.
  - Customize the web server's index page.
  - Configure the DNS server for domain name resolution.
  - Set up a DHCP server for dynamic IP address allocation.

### Scenario 3: NAT Implementation
- **Objective**: Implement Network Address Translation (NAT) to enable internet connectivity for private IP addresses.
- **Tasks**:
  - Configure network devices and test the NAT service.
